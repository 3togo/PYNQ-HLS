    "This notebook will walk through the process of creatinga a Vivado HLS core. This notebook assumes that you are familiar with Vivado HLS and have already used Vivado HLS to write, simluate, and debug a C/C++ core for hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not already, add Vivado HLS to your executable path. In Cygwin, you can do this by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "source C:/Xilinx/Vivado/2017.1/settings64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "``` bash\n",
    "source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2017.1/settings64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These command assume that Vivado has been installed in `C:/Xilinx/Vivado` or `/opt/Xilinx/Vivado/`. If that is not the case, you should modify the commands above to match your installation path. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For higher performance data (such as an HLS Core interface that reads from DDR or BRAM), you can use the full AXI bus by providing `m_axi` instead of `s_axilite`. `m_axi` is a Master interface - it cannot be driven by the ARM Processing System.\n",

    "The ports window shows us the interface signals for our HLS core. The port names are unimportant in this example - what matters is the protocol field. The protocol field has three types: **s_axi_lite (AXI Lite, Slave Interface)**, **axis (AXI Stream Iterface)**, and **ap_ctrl_hs (Control Signals)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For best results in Vivado (and PYNQ) your core should provide **s_axi_lite**, **axis**, or **m_axi** interfaces for data transfer.
