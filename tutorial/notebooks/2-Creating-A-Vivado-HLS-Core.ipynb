    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not already, add Vivado HLS to your executable path. In Cygwin, you can do this by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "source C:/Xilinx/Vivado/2017.1/settings64.sh\n",
    "```\n",

    "We will be creating a simple 1-D Filter with 9 coefficients. This filter will provide two AXI-Streams, one AXI-Stream for input, and 1 AXI-Stream for output. The Filter core will also provide an AXI-Lite interface for memory-mapped writes that will configure the AXI 9 filter coefficients and HLS runtime configuration. \n",
